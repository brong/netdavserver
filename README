NAME
    Net::DAV::Server - Provide a DAV Server

SYNOPSIS
      my $filesys = Filesys::Virtual::Plain->new({root_path => $cwd});
      my $webdav = Net::DAV::Server->new();
      $webdav->filesys($filesys);

      my $d = HTTP::Daemon->new(
        LocalAddr => 'localhost',
        LocalPort => 4242,
        ReuseAddr => 1) || die;
      print "Please contact me at: ", $d->url, "\n";
      while (my $c = $d->accept) {
        while (my $request = $c->get_request) {
          my $response = $webdav->run($request);
          $c->send_response ($response);
        }
        $c->close;
        undef($c);
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a WebDAV server. WebDAV stands for "Web-based
    Distributed Authoring and Versioning". It is a set of extensions to the
    HTTP protocol which allows users to collaboratively edit and manage
    files on remote web servers.

    Net::DAV::Server provides a WebDAV server and exports a filesystem for
    you using the Filesys::Virtual suite of modules. If you simply want to
    export a local filesystem, use Filesys::Virtual::Plain as above.

    This module doesn't currently provide a full WebDAV implementation.
    However, I am working through the WebDAV server protocol compliance test
    suite (litmus, see http://www.webdav.org/neon/litmus/) and will provide
    more compliance in future. The important thing is that it supports
    cadaver and the Mac OS X Finder as clients.
